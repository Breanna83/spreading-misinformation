        <h1>The Dangers of Spreading Misinformation</h1>
        <h2>It's like a really bad game of telephone</h2>
        <p>Our animation is about the dangers of spreading misinformation. What happens is our main character watches a show in which
           Bad representation of people with Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is shown. She then goes to tell her friend about this
           adding her own interpretation of it which results in more misinformation being spread. That friend is coincidentally part of 
           a big podcast which millions of people listen to. While talking about it, they add there own assumptions in that are also wrong
           about the community. These millions of people know wrong information about a situation. Now lets say just one of those people goes
           and tell this to all of their friends? This is how a very hurtful cycle is born.</p>

<h4> A litle begind the scenes <h4>
    <p2>For the last couple of scenes (the one where the omniscient chair is speaking) we used some code to create better lighting. 
        [as seen below] In the classroom the light was to yellow and  we couldn't get the spotlight effect we were looking for, so we
        improvised and used some code instead. For some on the spot, rushed coding I have to admit was pretty effective and useful.<p2/>
