        <h1>The Dangers of Spreading Misinformation</h1>
        <h2>It's like a really bad game of telephone</h2>
        <p>Our animation is about the dangers of spreading misinformation. What happes is our main character watches a show in which
           bad representation of people with Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is shown. She then goes to tell her friend about this
           adding her own interpertaion of it which results in more misinformation beign spread. That friend is coincidntally part of 
           a big podcast which millions of people listen to. While talking about it, they add there own assumptions in that are also wrong
           about the community. Thse millions of people know wrong information about a situation. Now lets say just one of those people goes
           and tell this to all of their friends? This is how a very hurtful cycle is born.</p>
